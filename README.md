### Crew History, Established 2001

In 2000 the BLM made the decision to add four hotshot crews. The Upper
Snake River District (now Idaho Fall District) was chosen to host one of
these crews in Pocatello, Idaho. Randy Anderson was hired in March 2001
as the superintendent and in approximately 2 months the crew was hired,
equipment purchased, vehicles scrounged and we were up and running. The
crew maintained trainee status for the entire 2001 season and received
hotshot certification in 2002. The crew has a great mutual relationship with
the BLM of Idaho and the Idaho Falls District in regards to fuels projects
and providing experienced personnel in leadership roles. Kenney Bochniak,
an original crewmember from 2001, and Paul Davis are the current crew
foreman. In December 2014 the crew moved into a new operations building
on BLM land in Pocatello.

### Crew History

The Fulton Hotshot Crew was started on the Greenhorn Ranger District, of the Sequoia
National Forest as a 6-person suppression crew that worked out of the Fulton Work
Center throughout the 1960’s. There were two other 6-person suppression crews, one
worked out of Davis Camp and the other worked out of Richbar Guard Station. When a
fire assignment was filled, the district combined the three crews for a total of 18
personnel and sent them to the assignment.
In 1969 and early 1970 the district combined and mobilized the three stations to form a
total of 15-20 personnel. In June of 1970 Ed Masonheimer formed the Fulton crew and
became the first crew Foreman established at Fulton Station. Ed started the hiring,
preparing for the crew, building barracks, acquiring a crew truck, but the crew did not
show up for duty until late June of 1970. Later, Bill Sandborg, in and around the month
of August became the crew Foreman. At this time, Bill Sandborg called the crew
“Fulton Hotshots”, while on fire assignments and was severely reprimanded by Dick
Montague from the Regional Office.

Although Bill put up an outstanding fight on why they should be called the Fulton
Hotshots, he never convinced Dick Montague, Region 5 Director of Fire and Aviation,
until 1973 when the crew was assigned to the Pillikan Fire on the Eldorado National
Forest.

Well the story goes as follows: apparently the crew had pulled five straight 24-hour
shifts and picked up a large portion of the fire which was considered the highest priority
on the incident. The Regional Fire Staff was visiting the incident due to its high publicity.
Upon the completion of Fulton’s assignment, Dick Montague visited the area of concern
on the fire. At that time the Fulton crew was returning from their shift and ran into Dick
Montague while walking off the fireline, after their 5 continuous shifts. Dick Montague
was so impressed that at that time he announced, congratulated, and awarded Bill
Sandborg and the Fulton crew as now being recognized as the Fulton Hotshots
Nationally.

Although all the Hotshot Crews were being established around that time frame, Fulton
was a little ahead of its time in 1973. The year 2020 will mark 50 years from the time
the Fulton Hotshots were established..
