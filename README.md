# [Interagency Hotshot Crews History](https://github.com/InteragencyHotshotCrews/History/blob/main/Interagency_Hotshot_Crews_History.md)

Welcome to the *new* home of the Interagency Hotshot Crews History. Please update your links to this *authoritative* source.

There are two versions available. 
1. A [*web*](https://github.com/InteragencyHotshotCrews/History/blob/main/Interagency_Hotshot_Crews_History.md) version at the link above.
2. A [*pdf*](https://github.com/InteragencyHotshotCrews/History/releases/download/v2022/2022_Interagency_Hotshot_Crews_History.pdf) version available for download from the [Releases](https://github.com/InteragencyHotshotCrews/History/releases) page of this repository.

## Development

The 2022 version of the History transitioned to this web-based format in an effort to host a single authoritative source and modernize it. The following steps were used, which resulted in formatting differences from previous versions. 

1. The original 2022 `.pdf` file, which was compiled and updated by David Provencio, Jr., was converted to `.docx`.
2. The `.docx` file was converted to [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (`.md`)[^1] using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) for the *web* version.
3. The resulting file was cleaned up manually. 
4. The `.md` file was converted to `.pdf` using Pandoc (via [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)) for the downloadable version.
